DeGym DAO introduces a DLT-based membership system using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to revolutionize gym access. Members purchase NFTs as proof of membership through platforms like MetaMask, selecting from various durations (weekly, monthly, yearly) and tiers (Basic, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Black).

**Features of NFT Memberships**

1. **Flexibility**: Each wallet can hold one or more NFTs, allowing members to possess multiple memberships simultaneously.
2. **Renewability**: NFT memberships are designed to be extendable, ensuring continuous access without re-purchase hassles.
3. **Scalability**: Members can upgrade or downgrade their membership tier to suit changing fitness needs and goals.

**Purchasing and Managing NFT Memberships**

* **Purchase**: Use MetaMask to buy NFT memberships directly on the DeGym platform.
* **Management**: Track and manage your memberships through the DeGym app, with options to renew, upgrade, or downgrade as needed.

**Setting Up Your Account:**

1. **Connecting**: Connect your metamask on the DeGym DApp.
2. **Choosing a Membership**: Select a membership that suits your fitness goals. Each membership comes in the form of an NFT, which allows access to multiple gyms in our network.

**Using Your Membership:**

1. **Accessing Gyms**: Utilize the DeGym Dapp to check into any participating gym. Your NFT membership simplifies entry, making gym hopping convenient and hassle-free.
2. **Tracking Your Visits**: Keep track of your gym visits and activities through the Dapp, helping you stay on top of your fitness progress.



**Staying Engaged:**

1. **Community Interaction**: Participate in community events and challenges to stay motivated and connected with other fitness enthusiasts.
2. **Feedback and Support**: Provide feedback on your experiences at different gyms to help us improve and tailor our services to better meet your needs.

**Safety and Etiquette:**

1. **Respect Gym Rules**: Adhere to the specific rules and regulations of each gym you visit to maintain a safe and enjoyable environment for all.
2. **Health and Safety**: Follow health guidelines to ensure your safety and the well-being of others, especially in shared spaces.

**Access and Restrictions**

* Not all gyms accept all tier memberships; higher-tier memberships provide access to a broader range of gyms.
* Lower-tier gym facilities will accept check-ins from all higher-tier memberships, maximizing accessibility and flexibility for users.

This innovative approach aligns with the broader vision of DeGym DAO to make fitness accessible, enjoyable, and integrated with the latest in distributed ledger technology.
