# Membership NFTs

**Nature and Functionality**

In DeGym DAO, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) serve as digital certificates that represent membership in various gyms within the network. These tokens are unique, secure, and blockchain-based, ensuring that each membership can be easily verified and cannot be duplicated.

**Types and Tiers**

DeGym NFTs come in multiple tiers, ranging from Basic to Black, offering different levels of access and benefits. This tier system allows users to choose a membership that best suits their lifestyle and fitness goals.

**Flexibility and Benefits**

* **Portability**: NFTs can be used across a wide network of gyms without the need for multiple memberships.
* **Upgradeability**: Members can upgrade or downgrade their NFTs to adjust their access level as their needs change.
* **Tradability**: These NFTs can potentially be traded on various NFT marketplaces, providing liquidity and flexibility to gym memberships.

**Integration with DeGym Platform**

The NFTs are integrated into the DeGym platform, allowing for seamless check-ins at gyms, tracking of gym visits, and participation in reward programs.

Through these NFTs, DeGym DAO revolutionizes how individuals access and utilize gym facilities, making fitness more accessible and adapted to digital and mobile lifestyles.
